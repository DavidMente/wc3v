# wc3v

 (WIP) warcraft 3 replay viewer.

 Goal is to simulate enough of wc3 to get a 'birds eye view'
 of the match from a given replay.

# Usage

run

`node wc3v.js`

# Progress

Currently the wc3v system is able to process very basic unit moving pathing.

Only supporting `Echo Isles` map currently, but plan to introduce
map loading + parsing for dynamic map information.
